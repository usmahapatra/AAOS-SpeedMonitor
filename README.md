# AAOS Speed Monitor Assignment

This project simulates over-speed detection and alerting for a rental car system using Kotlin. Alerts are triggered via mocked Firebase notifications and printed warnings.

## Technologies
- Kotlin
- Android Studio (No UI)
- Firebase (mocked)

## How to Run
Just run `main()` from `Main.kt` to simulate a session.

## Assumptions
- Speed is fed into the system via `onSpeedChanged()`.
- Firebase and AWS integration are mocked using `println()`.
- UI is not implemented as per instructions.
